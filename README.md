## Installation

Create conda environment:

```bash
conda create -f environment.yaml
conda activate wb-mpc
```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Within the script, the following parameters are defined:
- Robot: Model and dynamics (whole-body or centroidal, see table below)
- Targets: Base velocity, and arm end-effector velocity/force
- OCP: Number of nodes and time discretization
- Gait: Type, period and swing parameters
- Solver: Type ("fatrop", "ipopt", or "osqp"), warm-starting, code-compilation

## Optimal Control Problem

### Dynamics

The table below shows the available dynamics models (whole-body and centroidal variants). See the paper for detailed benchmarking results.

For certain models, the argument `include_base` determines whether the base variable is part of the input (set in `args.py`). If it is included, the dynamics are ensured through a path constraint on each node. If it is not included, the base dynamics propagate through the state transition function.

### Parameters

The optimization parameters fall into the following categories:
- Initial state: `x_init`
- Tracking targets: `base_vel_des`, `arm_vel_des`, `arm_force_des`
- Gait schedule: `contact_schedule` (0 or 1), `swing_schedule` (phase between 0 and 1)
- Tunable parameters:
    - `Q_diag`, `R_diag`: Diagonals of the weight matrices
    - `swing_period`, `swing_height`, `swing_vel_limits`: Swing trajectory params
    - `dt_min`, `dt_max`: Initial and final time step sizes of the geometric series
    - `n_contacts`: Number of stance feet (eg. 2 for trot)

## Solvers

### Interior-Point: Fatrop and Ipopt

The interior-point solvers **Fatrop** and **Ipopt** are supported, which directly solve the constrained nonlinear optimization problem until convergence.

As described in the paper, **Fatrop** exploits the block-sparse structure of stage-wise constriants, and shows a >10x speedup over **Ipopt** (higher speedup for longer horizons). The solver is warm-started with the MPC solution from the previous iteration. 

### Sequential Quadratic Programming: OSQP

Instead of solving the full NLP, it is converted to a Sequential Quadruatic Program (SQP). Each SQP iteration is solved with OSQP, and the solution is updated using the Armijo line-search method.


### Code-generation

Currently code-generation is only supported for **Fatrop**, since it showed the most promising results in terms of solve-time and convergence. See the `/codegen` folder for how to generate C code for the solver and compile it to a shared library.

For hardware deployment the shared library can be loaded with `casadi::external` in C++. This allows for straight forward deployment without having to reformulate the optimization problem in C++. It also allows for real-time parameter tuning.

## B2 + Z1 IDTO backend

An additional IDTO backend accepts the existing Pinocchio state format and runs
B2 + Z1 optimization and closed-loop Drake simulation. It includes a Docker
runner and a host-side client for environments using a different Python version.
See [the IDTO integration guide](idto_mpc/README.md) for commands, state mappings,
validation results, and current tracking / real-time limitations.

```bash
bash scripts/run_idto.sh --duration 2
```
